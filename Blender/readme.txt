This folder contains python scripts for Blender. These scripts are not meant to be run with Godot.

However, these scripts are useful as part of an export/import pipeline for Godot. They are included in this repository for convenience.

Usage: In Blender's Scripting tab, paste the script into a new document. Save, then run. Pleaes read doctrings in relevant scripts for more information.
